<h4><a name='active'>ACTIVE SKILL CATEGORIES</a></h4>

<p>Active Skills are subdivided into several different types:<br>
combat, magical, physical, social, technical and vehicle skills.<br>
The base skills described below appear in the following format:<br>
- General skill name (linked Attribute)<br>
- Definition of skill, with the notation (B/R) for a corresponding Build/Repair Skill (see Build/Repair Skills, below)<br>
- Default skills</p>

<h5><a name='br'>BUILD/REPAIR SKILLS</a></h5>

<p>Many Active Skills have a corresponding Build/Repair(B/R) Skill. These B/R counterparts assume that the characterhas access to the tools and/or equipment commonly used inthat area of expertise. For example, Edged Weapons (B/R)allows a character to make or repair swords or axes, whilePistols (B/R) allows a character to repair any pistol. Build/RepairSkills default to the Intelligence Attribute, and characters canspecialize in them according to specific weapon or item types.The character still needs time, tools and materials to buildsomething from scratch. Even a character with a superb level ofskill can do little without the proper equipment. If the character is trying to build something new, he or she also needs theoretical knowledge to design the item, unless someone elseprovides a detailed blueprint for its construction.</p>

<hr>

<h4><a name='knowledge'>ABOUT KNOWLEDGE SKILLS</a></h4>

<p>Players can choose Knowledge Skills from any of five categories: Street, Academic, Sixth World, Background and Interests. Many Knowledge Skills also provide the character with the theoretical basis of actions related to the field of study and the expertise for new designs in an area. During character creation, each player is given a certain number of points with which to buy Knowledge Skills; afterward, new Knowledge Skills must be purchased like any other skill, even if a character increases his or her Intelligence Attribute. All Knowledge Skills default to a character’s Intelligence Attribute. Though Knowledge Skills are treated as separate skills rather than being grouped with any other skill, some skills may be similar to each other in scope, and so gamemasters may opt to use the standard default method from base skill to base skill. For example, if a character has the Academic Skill Zoology and the shadowrunning team needs to identify a new paracritter (which would normally require the Sixth World Skill of Paranormal Animals), the gamemaster may allow that character to default to his Zoology Skill and apply only a +2 modifier to the target number rather than defaulting to Intelligence (which carries a +4 modifier). </p>

<h5>CHOOSING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS</h5>

<p>Knowledge Skills are the wild cards of SR3. Various Knowledge Skills are listed as examples below, but players and gamemasters should feel free to invent others that seem appropriate, useful or amusing, tailoring them to fit their campaigns. Knowledge Skills can add levels of detail and familiarity to characters and situations, especially if the gamemaster and players work together. No Knowledge Skill should ever be useless, not even Troll Thrash Metal Bands (to take one example). A runner with that skill might be a groupie, or might always schedule his or her meets at bars featuring that kind of music. Such a player character might even go on a shadowrun to get the nuyen to buy tickets to the big ten-act Trollapalooza show. Gamemasters should be cautious about allowing Knowledge Skills that are too broad-based. Some skills can be so all-encompassing that they upset game balance, or so generic that their usefulness is limited. Politics is an example of an overly broad Knowledge Skill. Politics, after all, comes in almost endless shapes and sizes. To allow this skill would give a character knowledge of political fields that have little connection, such as Mafia politics, UCAS politics and Tir Tairngire Council politics. However, any of those sub-categories would make a well-balanced Knowledge Skill; for example, Mafia Politics would make an excellent Street Knowledge Skill because it would provide the character with information on who’s who and what’s going down in the local Mafia hierarchy. Likewise, overgeneralized Knowledge Skills may overlap into several categories. Corporate Politics might be Academic (the corporate policies within any megacorporate organization) or Street (who do I need to sleep with to get the information I need) or Sixth World (Damien Knight and Richard Villiers were both seen in Seattle yesterday). In this case, the character needs to distinguish the Knowledge Skill category in which his Corporate Politics Skill is based. Each one is interesting in its own right, but radically different in background. Because Knowledge Skills in Shadowrun are open-ended, a skill that one character considers a base skill might be a specialization to another. These differing uses merely indicate a difference in focus and depth of knowledge. For example, Crash has a base skill in Elven Wine; he doesn’t know drek about other liquor, but he knows his elven wines. Cheetah, on the other hand, has Alcohol as a base Knowledge Skill with a specialization in Elven Wines. Both are legitimate. Crash likely knows more specific details about vintages and wineries than Cheetah does, but Cheetah will be able to tell anybody who cares how elven wine compares to other wines. Players should carefully think out their characters’ Knowledge Skills and determine why their character would have them. Knowledge Skills may also help provide players with insight into their characters, perhaps fleshing out the character’s background and history. Players may feel free to choose specializations for their Knowledge Skills, if they seem appropriate.</p>

<h5><a name='sixth'>SIXTH WORLD KNOWLEDGE</a></h5>

<p>This category covers the unique nature of the world now that magic has returned to it. For practical purposes, this skill covers the base of knowledge found within various Shadowrun sourcebooks. Sixth World Skills can cover specific individuals if a player wants to narrow in on someone they just can’t stop watching. Skill examples: Cybertechnology, Paranormal Animals, Elven Society, Megacorporate Policies, Metahumanity, Magic, Dragons, Atlantis Research, Data Havens, Legendary Deckers, Humanis Policlub </p>

<h5><a name='street'>STREET KNOWLEDGE</a></h5>

<p>Street Knowledge Skills are the skills learned on the mean streets of the sprawl. This kind of street savvy can only be learned from living, observing and surviving at the lowest levels of existence. These skills represent a character’s ability to use and maintain a level of contact with the street. Street Skills are usually location-specific; the Seattle Sprawl feels very different than the Denver Sprawl or the Berlin Sprawl. If a player wants to have the same skills in different locations, that player’s character must either specialize in a location (for example, Safehouse Locations is the base skill, Redmond Barrens is the specialization) or take the skill again for the new location if they have already specialized. Skill examples: Mafia-Controlled Establishments, Safehouse Locations, Gang Identification, Yakuza Territory, Lone Star Tactics, Criminal Organizations, Smuggling Routes, Prostitution Rackets, Fringe Cults, BTL Production, Police/Security Procedures</p>

<h5><a name='background'>BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE</a></h5>

<p>Background Knowledge Skills are based on Active Skills. Each Active Skill has a corresponding Background Skill. For example, a character might have Electronics as a Background Skill without having ever done any electronics work. Knowledge Skills like this represent an understanding of the basic principles, laws and facts behind any Active Skill. For example, Computer Background might mean you understand the how and why of decking. You may even understand the principles of iconography. However, that doesn’t mean you’ve ever jacked in (especially if you have no Computer Skill). Background Skills are useful for characters who cannot (or don’t wish to) perform an Active Skill, but want to know as much as they can about their enemies and how they operate. Any skill can be taken as a Background Skill. Characters with no Magic Attribute frequently take Background Skills in Conjuring and Sorcery, and characters who have no datajack or never deck often take computer Background Skills. Knowledge Skills follow the standard specializations of the corresponding Active Skills. For example, a character with a Background Skill in Conjuring can specialize in Banishing. As a character with an Active Skill becomes more proficient at it, he or she begins to learn theoretical background knowledge in that field. To represent this, gamemasters may allow players to assume, either during character creation or at no cost during play, Background Skills at a rating of 3 less than the rating in each related Active Skill they have. For example, if a character has Demolitions 5, that character would also have Background in Demolitions 2. As long as the Background Skill rating remains 3 less than the Active Skill rating, the player need not improve this Knowledge Skill; it automatically improves along with the Active Skill. If the player wants the Background Knowledge Skill to be higher than the Active Skill rating minus 3, he or she must improve it like any other Knowledge Skill.</p>

<h5><a name='academic'>ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE</a></h5>

<p>These Knowledge Skills are mostly learned through schooling and used by professionals and academics. They cover the basics of the natural world, the physical and social sciences, history, philosophy and the arts. Skill examples: Art, Biology, Zoology, Botany, Literature, Medicine, Parazoology, Parabotany, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Psychology, Anthropology, Archaeology, Politics, Philosophy, Economics, History, Music</p>

<h5><a name='interests'>INTERESTS</a></h5>

<p>Interests is the fun category, where you choose skills that give your character an inventive background and hobbies. The only limits are your imagination and what type of background you want your character to have.

<h4><a name='language'>ABOUT LANGUAGE SKILLS</a></h4>

<p>Language Skills are neither Active nor Knowledge Skills, but a little of both. Language Skills should be used only when language may cause a problem in communication, such as when a correct translation or message in a secondary language may be particularly important. It won’t bode well for the characters if their translator accidentally insults the Yakuza oyabun, or they can’t find the address of their safehouse because they didn’t quite understand when their contact whispered it to them in German. It is not necessary to roll dice for Language Skills to communicate on an everyday basis. Characters need not make tests to understand each other every time they speak. At character creation, a character receives a number of points for Language Skills equal to his or her Intelligence times 1.5. These points represent the language(s) they grew up speaking or the language(s) of their main surroundings. In most situations, a character will have the primary language of the game setting as his or her base language. Like all skills, languages can be improved and new languages learned as the game progresses. See Improving Skills, p. 244. All Language Skills default to Intelligence, imposing a +4 defaulting modifier. If the gamemaster feels that certain languages are similar enough in background, he or she can reduce the modifier to +2. For example, defaulting from Spanish to Italian or Portuguese may be +2 because of the strong similarities between those languages. Defaulting from Spanish to German, however, would impose a +4 penalty because Spanish and German come from entirely different sets of linguistic roots. The only language that stands alone, outside all known language classifications, is Sperethiel, the language of the elven race. Sperethiel is spoken in the elven nation of Tir Tairngire, near Seattle. Linguists are mystified as to its origins, claiming that its complexity and structure point to years of evolution. Its apparent lack of links to any other known language only adds to the puzzle. Sperethiel can be taken at character creation or learned as the game goes on. Despite its label as “the elven language,” characters other than elves may speak Sperethiel fluently, and elven characters may well not speak a word of it. Trolls, orks and dwarfs do not have race-specific languages. For information on determining target numbers and interpreting successes in Language Skill Tests, see Using Language Skills, p. 97.</p>

<h5><a name='lingo'>LINGOS</a></h5>

<p>Lingos are specializations of existing languages. They exist because a subgroup has created its own language from its specific terminology, phrasings and slang. Lingos can range from rigger-speak to legalese to street jive. Any language can have multiple lingo specializations, which follow all of the rules for Active Skill specializations. Common examples of lingos are Cityspeak (the language of the gangs and other “street-educated” people), Legalese (the language of lawyers and therefore of the business and political worlds), Netspeak (the language of deckers), Magetalk (the language of the magically active), Trog (the language of the Seattle Ork Underground), Military Jargon (those who have formal military training speak a language all their own), Scientific Jargon (the lingo of research scientists and people who never leave the lab) and so on. Players and gamemasters can create any lingo they feel enhances game play and makes for interesting character development. Some lingos, such as Cityspeak and Netspeak, have incorporated a fair number of visual clues, body language and hand signals that denote emphasis, inflection and so on.</p>

<h5><a name='rw'>READING AND WRITING</a></h5>

<p>Halfway through the twenty-first century, when Shadowrun takes place, reading and writing have lost much of their importance as society has become more attuned to icons and images. To reflect this trend, at character creation the ratings for all Reading and Writing Skills (R/W) are set at half the Language Skill on which they are based, rounded down. The reduced R/W rating reflects the fact that the average character can speak a language much better than he or she can read or write it. Like Language Skills, R/W Skills are assigned free at character creation, but can be improved as the game goes on. For purposes of improvement, R/W Skills are considered separate from Language Skills. Improving a Language Skill does not automatically improve the related R/W Skill. See Improving Skills, p. 244. If a character has a starting Language Skill of 1 or less, he or she does not get the associated R/W Skill. The character must learn that skill separately. Because lingos are almost exclusively spoken or visual, they have no corresponding R/W Skill. As with Language Skills, Reading and Writing Skills are not meant to slow the game down by having players roll dice every time their characters need to read or write. Instead, they are meant to provide the gamemaster with a mechanic for situations when quick or careful reading or writing is important to the plot.</p>
