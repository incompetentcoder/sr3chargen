<li>Magicians follow one of two traditions. A tradition is a set of beliefs and techniques for using magic. It colors the magician’s outlook and affects how the magician learns and uses magic. The choice of magical tradition is for life. Once you are on the path, there is no turning back.</li>
<li>A follower of the shamanic tradition is a <a href="#shaman">shaman</a>. Shamans focus their magic through their relationship with the world of nature and the power of emotion and inspiration. Magical knowledge comes to them from a spirit-patron known as a totem.</li>
<li>A follower of the hermetic tradition is a <a href="#mage">mage</a>. Hermetic magic is intellectual. Mages see the universe as a complex pattern of forces that can be controlled with the right formulae and rituals. Magical knowledge comes from intense study and research.</li>
<li><a href="#adepts">Adepts</a> follow their own unique path, the somatic way. They are concerned with the perfection of body and mind, focusing their magical power inward. Adepts learn their unique abilities through introspection and an awareness of self.</li>

<h4><a name='magicians'>MAGICIANS</a></h4>

<p>Magicians use the magical skills of Sorcery and Conjuring to perform magic. They also have various abilities relating to the astral plane (p. 171). Magicians come in two types: <a href="#fullmagic">full magicians</a> and <a href="#aspected">aspected magicians</a>.</p>

<h4><a name='adepts'>ADEPTS</a></h4>

<p>Adepts use magical powers to increase their abilities - they can&#39;t cast spells or conjure spirits. They cannot project astrally and have to buy a power if they want to be able to perceive astrally.</p>

<hr>

<h5><a name='fullmagic'>FULL MAGICIANS</a></h5>

<p>Full magicians have access to the full range of abilities of their chosen tradition (shamanic or hermetic). They can use the Sorcery and Conjuring skills (p. 177 and 184), access the astral plane through astral perception and astral projection (p. 171 and 172) and use foci to enhance their magical skills (p. 189).</p>

<h6><a name='shaman'>Shaman</a></h6>

<p>A shaman’s magic comes from the power of nature and thespirit world (the astral plane). Tribal cultures around the worldpractice shamanism. When the Awakening brought magic tothe world, native shamans were some of the first to successfully wield it. Shamanism also developed in many urban areas dur-ing the boom in occultism at the close of the 20th century.When the Awakening came, these “urban shamans” discoveredthe old ways worked in the cities just as well as the wilderness.To a shaman, the world is filled with living spirits, powersthe shaman calls on for magical aid. Shamans are in tune withthe natural flow of the energies of life and magic.</p>

<h6><a name='mage'>Mage</a></h6>

<p>A mage’s magic comes from a complex set of theoriesthat describe mana and the dimensions of astral space and howthey interact with the physical world. There are nearly as manyversions of these theories as there are mages. By understanding these interactions, mages can perform magic through ritual and focused power of will.Hermetic magic was studied widely even before the Awakening. Corporations and many governments took advantage of hermetic magic before they did shamanism, but evenmages, with their more rational approach to this new mystery,were initially met with skepticism. Once shamans like theGhost Dancers proved the power of magic, people took serious interest in the arts of the mage. Even today, far moremages work for corporations than shamans. (Youtry tellingCoyote he only gets an hour for lunch.) Mages are scholars who study and practice magic usingtried and established formulas and procedures. Mages continuously research the theories and laws of magic, seeking adeeper understanding of the structure of the universe. As theirknowledge increases, so does their power.</p>

<hr>

<h5><a name='aspected'>ASPECTED MAGICIANS</a></h5>

<p>Aspected magicians have access to a single aspect of their chosen tradition, as given in their individual descriptions. Aspected magicians are capable of astral perception, but not astral projection. They may bond and use any foci which aid the skills they can use. Otherwise, they follow the normal rules for magicians given in this chapter. Aspected magicians are sometimes called “semi-mundos” (semi-mundanes), “groggies” (half-Awakened), and other derogatory names by full magicians because of their limited abilities. On the other hand, aspected magicians are often more skilled in their particular specialty than full magicians.</p>

<h6><a name ='conjurer'>Conjurer</a></h6>

<p>Conjurers can use the Conjuring Skill, but cannot use Sorcery. Conjurers can be either shamans or mages. They follow the normal rules of their tradition for conjuring. Shaman conjurers get totem modifiers, if applicable, to their skill.</p>

<h6><a name ='elementalist'>Elementalist</a></h6>

<p>Elementalists are always mages. Elementalists can only cast spells and summon spirits related to one hermetic element. An earth elementalist can only cast manipulation spells and summon earth elementals. An air elementalist can only cast detection spells and summon air elementals. A fire elementalist can only cast combat spells and summon fire elementals. A water elementalist can only cast illusion spells and summon water elementals. Elementalists have full use of the Sorcery and Conjuring skills for all other purposes, like spell defense and banishing, but must subtract 1 die from their skill for spells or spirits of their opposing element. This modifier applies for spell defense, dispelling, banishing, controlling and so on. Earth and air are opposed, as are fire and water, so a fire elementalist subtracts 1 die from Sorcery when used against illusion spells and 1 die from his Conjuring when used against water elementals.</p>

<h6><a name ='shamanist'>Shamanist</a></h6>

<p>A shamanist, as the name implies, must be a shaman. Shamanists can only cast spells and summon spirits for which they receive a totem advantage. For example, a shamanist of Bear can only cast health spells and summon forest spirits. Shamanists are subject to all the requirements of their totem. It is impossible to be a shamanist of a totem like Coyote, which receives no totem modifiers, nor is it possible for a totem like Owl, where totem modifiers are based on time or place, but not purpose. Shamanists have normal use of Sorcery and Conjuring for all other purposes, like spell defense and banishing, affected by their totem modifiers as normal.</p>

<h6><a name ='sorcerer'>Sorcerer</a></h6>

<p>Sorcerers can use the Sorcery Skill, but cannot use Conjuring. Sorcerers can be either shamans or mages. They follow the rules of their tradition for Sorcery. Shaman sorcerers receive totem modifiers, if applicable, to their skill.</p>
