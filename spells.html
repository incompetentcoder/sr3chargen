<h4>STREET GRIMOIRE</h4>

<p>The following are the most common spells in use in thetwenty-first century shadows. The name given for each spell isthe common name used by shadowrunners. Spellcasters fromdifferent backgrounds may have different names for their spells,but their effects, and their game statistics, remain the same. Each spell has the following characteristics: Type, Target, Duration and Drain. Type is either Mana (M) or Physical (P). See p. 178 for more information. Target is the target number of the spell. Willpower (W), Body (B) and Intelligence (I) are the most common target numbers. Spells that affect non-living objects use Object Resistance (OR) as the target number. Other spells have a specific target number listed. Spells cast on an unwilling target require a Spell Resistance Test (p. 183). Duration is either Instant (I), Sustained (S) or Permanent (P). See p. 178 for more information. Drain consists of a modifier to the Drain’s Power (based on half the spell’s Force, rounded down) and the Drain Level, the base Damage Level the drain causes. Some spells have a variable Drain Level, particularly spells which inflict or heal damage. The Drain Level is based on the level of damage the spell may cause or heal. If a modifier would raise the Drain Level above Deadly, add +2 to the Drain Power instead for each level above Deadly. </p>

<hr>

<h4><a name='combat'>COMBAT SPELLS</a></h4>

<p>All combat spells work by damaging the target directly, bypassing physical armor and other non-magical forms of protection. A combat spell can affect any target in the caster’s line of sight. The caster of a combat spell chooses the spell’s base Damage Level when it is cast. The Damage Level determines the spell’s base Drain Level.</p>

<p><a name='death touch'>Death Touch</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: I • Drain: (Damage Level –1)<br>
Death Touch requires the caster to touch the target. The spell does physical damage to a single target. It is a mana spell, so it only affects living and magical targets and is resisted by Willpower.</p>

<p><a name='manabolt'>Manabolt</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: I • Drain: (Damage Level)<br>
<a name='manaball'>Manaball</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: I • Drain: (Damage Level +1) <br>
Manabolt and Manaball channel destructive magical power into the target, doing physical damage. As mana spells, they only affect living and magical targets and are resisted by Willpower (or Force). Manabolt affects a single target. Manaball is an area spell.</p>

<p><a name='powerbolt'>Powerbolt</a><br>
Type: P • Target: B • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level)<br>
<a name='powerball'>Powerball</a><br>
Type: P • Target: B • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level +1)<br>
Powerbolt and Powerball channel destructive magical power into the target, doing physical damage. These spells affect both living and non-living targets and are resisted by the target’s Body. The target number for non-living targets can be found on the Object Resistance Table (p. 182). Powerbolt affects a single target. Powerball is an area spell.</p>

<p><a name='stunbolt'>Stunbolt</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: I • Drain: –1(Damage Level)<br>
<a name='stunball'>Stunball</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: I • Drain: –1(Damage Level +1)<br>
Stun spells channel magical energy directly into the target, causing stun damage. They are often referred to as “sleep” spells because they can render targets unconscious. Stunbolt affects a single target. Stunball is an area spell.</p>

<hr>

<h4><a name='detection'>DETECTION SPELLS</a></h4>

<p>Detection spells give the subject a new sense beyond the normal five senses for as long as they are maintained. To determine the range at which the new sense operates, multiply the spell’s Force by the caster’s Magic Attribute for the distance in meters. The new sense is normally directional (like normal sight). Area detection spells sense things in all directions. They are not aimed at a specific target or targets, so a separate test need not be made for each target in range of the sense. The gamemaster makes a single Sorcery Test and compares the results against each potential target in range, using the Detection Spell Target Number and Detection Spell Results tables to determine the target number and the result. If a caster sustains an area detection spell, new targets are picked up as they enter the range of the spell. The results of the original Sorcery Test still apply. Detection spells can be cast on any willing subject (including the caster), providing them the benefits of the sense. The subject must be touched by the caster to receive the spell. Anyone who is not voluntarily being detected by a detection spell (whether they are aware of the spell or not) may make a Spell Resistance Test using Willpower, reducing the caster’s successes normally.</p>

<p><a name='analyze device'>Analyze Device</a><br>
Type: P • Target: OR • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
Allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense. Every two successes gives the character a single skill point in a corresponding or logical Background or Build/Repair Skill Rating for the device in question, up to maximum skill rating or bonus equal to the Force of the spell. The subject’s previous familiarity with the device or similar objects reduces the target number by –2.</p>

<p><a name='analyze truth'>Analyze Truth</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: L <br>
The subject can tell whether or not a target’s statements are the truth. Half-truths, or falsehoods the target believes to be true, are not detected by this spell. The spell needs at least 1 success to determine validity. The spell does not work on written materials or any sort of electronic communication. The subject must hear a statement in person to know if it is true or not. <br>
<a name='clairaudience'>Clairaudience</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 6 • Duration: S • Drain: M<br>
The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present, to the range of the new sense. The subject must concentrate to use this sense, and while using it, cannot use normal hearing. This spell does not translate visual images, only sounds.</p>

<p><a name='clairvoyance'>Clairvoyance</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 6 • Duration: S • Drain: M<br>
The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present, to the range of the new sense. The subject must concentrate to use this sense and cannot use normal vision or astral perception while using it. Magicians cannot target spells using clairvoyance. Astral perception cannot be used in conjunction with clairvoyance. Other vision enhancements possessed by the subject (natural or cybernetic), function through this spell. The spell does not translate sound.</p>

<p><a name='combat sense'>Combat Sense</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: S<br>
The subject can subconsciously analyze combat and other dangerous situations within range of the sense. The subject senses events a split-second before they happen. Every 2 successes on the Sorcery Test add 1 die to the subject&#39;s Combat Pool for the duration of the spell, up to a maximum bonus equal to the Force of the spell. Combat Sense is not resisted, since it affects only the subject.</p>

<p><a name='detect enemies'>Detect Enemies</a><br>
Type: M • Target: See table above • Duration: S • Drain: M<br>
The subject can detect living targets within range who have hostile intentions toward him. The spell does not detect traps (since they are not alive), nor can it detect someone about to shoot into a crowd at random (the hostility is not directed at the subject of the spell). The spell can detect an ambush or other surprise attack.</p>

<p><a name='detect individual'>Detect Individual</a><br>
Type: M • Target: See table, p. 192 • Duration: S • Drain: L<br>
The subject can detect the presence of a specific individual anywhere within range of the sense. The caster names the individual when the spell is cast.</p>

<p><a name='detect life'>Detect Life</a><br>
Type: M • Target: See table, p. 192 • Duration: S • Drain: L<br>
The subject detects all living beings within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. In a crowded area, the spell is virtually useless, picking up only a blurred mass.</p>

<p><a name='detect lifeform'>Detect (Life Form)</a><br>
Type: M • Target: See table, p.192 • Duration: S • Drain: –1(L)<br>
The subject detects all of a specified type of life form within the range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each different life form requires a separate spell (Detect Orks, Detect Elves, Detect Dragons, and so forth).</p>

<p><a name='detect magic'>Detect Magic</a><br>
Type: M • Target: See table p.192 • Duration: S • Drain: L<br>
The subject can detect the presence of all foci, spells and spirits within range of the sense. It does not detect Awakened characters or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.</p>

<p>Detect (Object)<br>
Type: P • Target: See table, p. 192 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
The subject detects all of a specified type of object within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each type of object requires a separate spell (Detect Guns, Detect Computers, Detect Explosives, and so on).</p>

<p><a name='mindlink'>Mindlink</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: S<br>
Mindlink allows two voluntary subjects to communicate mentally, exchanging conversation, emotions and mental images. One success on the Sorcery Test is enough to establish the link. The subjects must be within line of sight of the caster. Once the spell is cast, the subjects must remain within the range of the sense, but may move out of line of sight.</p>

<p><a name='mind probe'>Mind Probe</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: S<br>
This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a visible target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). If the caster gains one or more successes, consult the Mind Probe Results Table for the information gained. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Initiative Pass. For each additional use of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower, add +2 to the target number per attempt.</p>

<hr>

<h4><a name='health'>HEALTH SPELLS</a></h4>

<p>Health spells can heal physical injury, cure diseases (or inflict them), detoxify poisons or drugs (or mimic their effects), as well as modify Attributes. No techniques currently known to magic can erase fatigue, cure psychological conditions or cure Drain. All health spells require the caster to touch the target of the spell. This “laying on hands” is traditional in magical healing lore the world over.</p>

<p><a name='antidote'>Antidote</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Toxin Strength • Duration: P • Drain: (Toxin Damage Level)<br>
This spell helps a poisoned subject to overcome the toxin. Each success reduces the toxin’s Power by 1, up to a maximum of the spell’s Force, making it easier for the target to make Resistance Tests against the toxin. It must be cast before the toxin does damage.</p>

<p><a name='curedisease'>Cure Disease</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Power • Duration: P • Drain: (Disease Damage Level)<br>
This spell can be used at any point after infection, helping the patient overcome illness. Each success on the Sorcery Test reduces the Power of the disease by 1, up to a maximum of the spell’s Force, making it easier for the target to make Resistance Tests against it. It does not heal damage already done by the disease; that takes a separate healing spell.</p>

<p><a name='decreaseattribute'>Decrease (Attribute)</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 10 – Essence • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
<a name='decreasecyberedattribute'>Decrease (Cybered Attribute)</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 10 – Essence • Duration: S • Drain: +2(S)<br>
The target resists the spell using the Attribute affected. If the caster wins, every 2 net successes reduces the Attribute by 1, up to a maximum reduction equal to the Force of the spell. If a Physical Attribute is reduced to 0, the victim is paralyzed. If a Mental Attribute is reduced to 0, the victim stands about mindlessly. A version of this spell exists for each of the Physical and Mental Attributes, but not the Special Attributes (Essence, Magic and Reaction). The Decrease (Attribute) spell does not affect Attributes modified by cyberware. Decrease (Cybered Attribute) works the same as Decrease (Attribute) except it only affects Attributes modified by cyberware.</p>

<p><a name='detox'>Detox</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Toxin Strength • Duration: P • Drain: –2(Toxin Damage)<br>
Detox relieves the effects of a drug or poison as long as the Force of the spell is equal to or greater than the Power Rating of the toxin. A single success is sufficient to eliminate all symptoms. Detox does not heal or prevent damage done by toxins, but it eliminates any side-effects they may have on the victim (dizziness, hallucinations, nausea, pain and so forth). Detox is the hangover cure of choice among those who can afford it.</p>

<p><a name='heal'>Heal</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 10 – Essence • Duration: P • Drain: (Wound Level)<br>
Treat<br>
Type: M • Target: 10 – Essence • Duration: P • Drain: –1(Wound Level)<br>
Both Heal and Treat repair physical injuries. Each success from the Sorcery Test can heal one box of physical damage (up to a maximum equal to the spell’s Force), or be used to reduce the base time for the spell to become permanent. Divide the base time by the successes. The total successes can be split between the two uses (healing and time reduction) as the caster desires. Treat must be applied within one hour of injury, but it takes only half the normal time (round down) to become permanent. Heal may be applied anytime. A character can only be magically healed once for any single set of injuries. The Drain Level of the spell is equal to the subject’s Wound Level when the spell is cast.</p>

<p><a name='increasereflex'>Increase Reflexes +1</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Reaction • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
<a name='increasereflex2'>Increase Reflexes +2</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Reaction • Duration: S • Drain: +1(D)<br>
<a name='increasereflex3'>Increase Reflexes +3</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Reaction • Duration: S • Drain: +3(D)<br>
This spell increases the Initiative dice of a voluntary target. If the spell is successful, the subject’s Initiative dice are increased by the amount indicated for the spell (+1, +2, or +3). There is no cyberware version of this spell, so characters that have cybernetic enhancements that add Reaction or Initiative dice (like wired reflexes) cannot be boosted by this spell. Increase Reflexes is not compatible with any other type of increase to a subject’s Initiative dice, including the adept power of Improved Reflexes.</p>

<p><a name='healthy glow'>Healthy Glow</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: P • Drain: L<br>
This spell brightens eyes and hair, sloughs off dead skin cells, improves circulation and promotes general well-being. A cosmetic spell, the rich use Healthy Glow as a status symbol and pick-me-up. Though “permanent” in the sense that it does not require sustaining, the spell wears off in Force x 24 hours.</p>

<p><a name='oxygenate'>Oxygenate</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +2(L)<br>
This spell oxygenates the blood of a voluntary subject, providing extra Body dice (1 die for every 2 successes) to resist suffocation, strangulation, the effects of inhaled gas or any other effect of oxygen deprivation. The spell also allows the subject to breathe underwater.</p>

<p><a name='hibernate'>Hibernate</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
The caster must touch a voluntary or unconscious target. The spell puts the subject in a form of suspended animation. Double the successes from the Sorcery Test (up to a maximum number of successes equal to the spell’s Force). This is the factor by which bodily processes are slowed. If 4 successes are scored with Hibernate, the subject’s metabolism is slowed by a factor of 8. A target sealed into a chamber with enough air to keep it alive for a day, for example, would be able to last eight days.</p>

<p><a name='prophylaxis'>Prophylaxis</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(L)<br>
This spell provides additional dice (+1 die per 2 successes up to the spell’s Force) for a voluntary target to resist infection, drugs, or toxins. The spell does not discriminate between harmful and beneficial drugs, so the subject also resists medicines and other helpful drugs while under the effects of the spell. Reduce the effect of a beneficial drug by 1 for every 2 successes of the spell. Two or more successes prevent the subject from being affected by alcohol while under the effect of this spell.</p>

<p><a name='increaseattrib'>Increase (Attribute)</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Attribute • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
<a name='increasecyberedattrib'>Increase (Cybered Attribute)</a><br>
Type: P • Target: Attribute • Duration: S • Drain: +2(M)<br>
These spells increase a Physical or Mental Attribute for a voluntary subject. Each Attribute requires a separate spell (Increase Strength, Increase Intelligence, and so forth). The target number is the Attribute to be increased. Every two successes increase the Attribute by 1, up to a maximum bonus equal to the Force of the spell. Increase Attribute does not affect Attributes modified by cyberware. Increases to Quickness and Intelligence increase Reaction normally. Each Attribute can only be affected by a single Increase Attribute spell at a time. The Increase Cybered Attribute spell works the same as above, but can only increase Attributes modified by cyberware.</p>

<p><a name='resist pain'>Resist Pain</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: P • Drain: –2(Damage)<br>
Resist Pain allows the subject to ignore the pain of injuries, reducing the penalties from physical damage (but not stun damage). Each success on the Sorcery Test removes the effect of one box of damage from the subject’s Physical Damage Monitor, up to a maximum equal to the spell’s Force. It does not remove the damage itself, only eliminates the modifiers. Resist Pain can only be used once on any given set of injuries. It cannot be used to counteract Deadly damage, because any character with a Deadly injury is unconscious and must be healed. The spell is “permanent” in that the boost to the patient’s endorphin levels does not wear off. If the subject’s damage rises above the Condition Level at which the patient is resisting pain or the existing injuries heal, the spell dissipates.</p>

<p><a name='increase reaction'>Increase Reaction</a><br>
Type: M • Target: Reaction • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
The Increase Reaction spell increases the Reaction Attribute of a voluntary subject. Every two successes increase Reaction by 1, up to a maximum bonus equal to the Force of the spell. Subjects whose Reaction Attribute is already improved by cyberware cannot be affected by this spell.</p>

<p><a name='stabilize'>Stabilize</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 + minutes • Duration: P • Drain: +1(M)<br>
When applied to a character with Deadly physical damage, this spell stabilizes all vital functions and prevents the character from dying. The spell&#39;s Force must be equal to or greater than the overflow damage taken by the character for this spell to have any effect on the injured character. No Body Test is needed to determine if the character dies. The caster must add the number of minutes elapsed since the character took the Deadly damage to the target number for the Sorcery Test.</p>

<hr>

<h4><a name='illusion'>ILLUSION SPELLS</a></h4>

<p>No matter how realistic they are, illusions cannot cause permanent harm. They can cause distractions, loss of balance or orientation, and even symptoms like nausea or pain. All such effects vanish as soon as the caster drops the illusion. Illusions can certainly cause harm by manipulating the senses so a victim walks into traffic or off a high building, for example, but they cannot directly cause damage. Obvious illusions are used solely for entertainment and cannot fool subjects into believing they are real. Single-sense illusions affect only one sense. Full sensory illusions affect all senses. Although mana illusions can appear on the astral plane, their magical auras give them away as illusions to anyone who makes a successful Assensing Test (see Astral Perception, p. 171). Illusions do not disguise or create auras. Mana-based illusion spells affect the mind and are ineffective against technological viewing systems like cameras. Physical illusion spells create actual sensory input and are effective against such systems. If the observer generates equal or more successes in a Resistance Test, then the observer determines that the illusion is not real. If the spell is not completely resisted, the character is fully affected by the illusion. Illusion spells can affect any target or area within the caster’s line of sight.</p>

<h5><a name='dillusion'>DIRECTED ILLUSION SPELLS</a></h5>

<p>Directed illusion spells are cast at a target and affect his mind or senses. Others are not affected unless the spell is cast at them as well (or they are in the area of effect). Directed illusions only affect those within the caster’s line of sight. Mana illusions are resisted by Willpower, while physical illusions are resisted by Intelligence.</p>

<p><a name='confusion'>Confusion</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: S<br>
<a name='mass confusion'>Mass Confusion</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: D<br>
These spells produce a storm of conflicting sensations and images to confuse the senses. For each success on the Sorcery Test, the subject suffers +1 on all target numbers from the distraction, up to a maximum equal to the Force of the spell. Confusion affects a single target. Mass Confusion is an area spell.</p>

<p><a name='chaos'>Chaos</a><br>
Type: P • Target: I • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
<a name='chaotic world'>Chaotic World</a><br>
Type: P • Target: I • Duration: S • Drain: +1(D)<br>
The Chaos spell is a physical version of Confusion (above), it also affects technological systems and sensing devices. Chaotic World is an area version of Chaos.</p>

<p><a name='entertainment'>Entertainment</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: L<br>
<a name='trid entertainment'>Trid Entertainment</a><br>
Type: P • Target: I • Duration: S • Drain: +1(L)<br>
These area spells require voluntary targets. They create obvious, but entertaining, visual illusions. The successes measure how entertaining the audience finds the illusion. The caster can re-create an image of anything with a successful Sorcery Test. The gamemaster might require additional successes for exact details. Entertainment affects the minds of the subjects and cannot be detected by non-living sensors. Trid Entertainment is a physical spell, and can be perceived by both living subjects and non-living sensors. These spells are used for amusement as well as art. The entertainment industry uses illusionists as literal “special effects wizards.” Magical designers and artists work to create new and interesting sensations, including sensations that can’t otherwise be experienced in the real world. Only the wealthy can afford the unique experiences offered by such spellcasters.</p>

<hr>

<h5><a name='iillusion'>INDIRECT ILLUSION SPELLS</a></h5>

<p>Indirect illusion spells manipulate energy to create an illusionary image or sound or other sense-based effect, fooling the senses. They must be cast “around” a person, or over an area (Magic rating in meters) that is within the caster’s line of sight. All indirect illusions are resisted by Intelligence.</p>

<p><a name='invisibility'>Invisibility</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: M<br>
<a name='improved invisibility'>Improved Invisibility</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
This spell makes the subject invisible to normal vision. The subject is completely tangible and detectable by the other senses. Their aura is still visible to astral perception. Attacks against invisible targets suffer the Blind Fire modifier (p. 111) if the attacker is unable to see or otherwise sense the target of the spell. Invisibility affects the minds of viewers. Improved invisibility affects technological sensors as well.</p>

<p><a name='mask'>Mask</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: M<br>
<a name='physical mask'>Physical Mask</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
The mask spell alters the target’s voice, scent and other physical characteristics. The target assumes a physical appearance (of the same basic size and shape), chosen by the caster. Observers can make a Resistance Test to attempt to overcome the illusion. Mask affects the minds of viewers. Physical Mask creates an illusion that affects technological sensors as well.</p>

<p><a name='phantasm'>Phantasm</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: D<br>
<a name='trid phantasm'>Trid Phantasm</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(D)<br>
These area spells create convincing visual illusions of any object or creature the caster desires. They can create an illusion of anything the caster has seen before, from a flower or a credstick to a dragon breathing fire, so long as the illusion is no larger than the spell’s area. The illusion appears real unless the observer is able to make a successful Resistance Test to penetrate the illusion. Phantasm can only be detected by living beings, while Trid Phantasm creates images detectable by technological sensors as well.</p>

<p><a name='silence'>Silence</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
Silence creates an area that dampens sound. Because it is a physical spell, Silence affects technological devices and is useful for jamming alarms, detection devices, sonar and tactical communications. Sonic attacks into or out of the field are reduced in Power by the Force of the spell. All Hearing Perception Test target numbers within or across the field are increased by +1 per success on the Sorcery Test, up to a maximum equal to the Force of the spell.</p>

<p><a name='stealth'>Stealth</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
Stealth is cast on a target who becomes inaudible to normal hearing. The subject can move in complete silence and nothing they do makes noise. Things not being touched by the subject can still make noise, so a character under a stealth spell would make no noise knocking on a door, but the door would make noise hitting the floor or wall if it was kicked in.</p>

<h4><a name='manipulation'>MANIPULATION SPELLS</a></h4>

<p>Manipulation spells control, animate or transform matter and energy. Many manipulation spells have a Threshold; this is a number of successes required for the spell to function. If, after the Spell Resistance Test, the caster’s successes do not equal or exceed the Threshold of the spell, the spell fails. Manipulation spells can affect any target in the caster’s line of sight.</p>

<h5><a name='control'>CONTROL MANIPULATIONS</a></h5>

<p>Control manipulations affect the actions and the thoughts of living beings. They are resisted using Willpower and have a Threshold equal to half the target’s Willpower (round down).</p>

<p><a name='control actions'>Control Actions</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
The caster controls the physical actions of a target like a puppeteer pulling strings. The victim’s consciousness is unaffected, but the caster controls the victim’s body. The victim uses any skills or abilities at the caster’s orders, but with +4 to all target numbers because of the victim’s resistance to the caster’s commands.</p>

<p><a name='control emotion'>Control Emotion</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
The target feels an overwhelming emotion chosen by the spellcaster, such as love, hate, sorrow and so on. The target believes the emotion wholeheartedly, but not mindlessly. Generally speaking, a target doing something in keeping with the emotion (fighting while filled with anger or hate), suffers no penalty. If doing something not relevant to the emotion (trying to drive while laughing hysterically), a distraction applies (+2 to all target numbers). If the target tries to go against the emotion (trying to shoot a “loved” target), he must make a Willpower Test against the spell’s Force in order to act. A +2 distraction penalty applies even if the test succeeds.</p>

<p><a name='control thoughts'>Control Thoughts</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
The caster seizes control of the target’s mind, directing everything the target does. The caster can mentally give commands as a Simple Action and the target is compelled to obey. Commands the target is deeply opposed to can be fought with a Willpower Test against the spell’s Force, one test per command. If the caster is not present, a single success will overcome the spell. If the caster is present, roll the caster’s Willpower against the target’s Willpower. The caster’s successes reduce the target’s. One net success is all that is required for the target to resist the command and break the spell.</p>

<p><a name='influence'>Influence</a><br>
Type: M • Target: W • Duration: P • Drain: S<br>
This spell implants a single suggestion in the victim’s mind, like a powerful post-hypnotic command. The subject will carry out this suggestion as if it were his own idea and it will then fade. If someone points out that what the target is doing is wrong, the target can make a Willpower Test to overcome the suggestion as described for the Control Thoughts spell. The caster can also withdraw the suggestion at any time.</p>

<hr>

<h5><a name='elemental'>ELEMENTAL MANIPULATIONS</a></h5>

<p>Elemental manipulation spells create matter or energy and direct it to cause damage. Unlike combat spells, these spells are treated like normal ranged attacks (see p. 109) using Sorcery as the Ranged Combat Skill. They have a base Target Number of 4, regardless of range, as long as the caster can see the target. Impact Armor protects against damage from elelmental manipulations, but at only half its normal rating (round down). The caster chooses the spell’s Base Damage Level when it is cast, which also determines the base Drain Level. Elemental spells do primary damage determined by the Damage Code of the spell. They also have secondary effects, the effects the spell has on the environment. For example, a Fireball might start fires, cook off ammo, ignite fuel tanks, and set fire to armor and clothing all over the blast zone. An Acid Stream can melt surrounding material into smoking sludge. If, after applying the primary damage of the spell, anyone is left standing and in some way vulnerable to the secondary effects, roll 2D6 to determine the effect for any non-living targets. The result must be greater than or equal to the target’s Object Resistance Rating (p. 182). Add +2 to the Object Resistance if the spell has a base damage of Serious, and +4 if its base damage is Moderate. An elemental spell with a Damage Level of Light does not cause secondary effects. When dealing with secondary effects, the gamemaster will have to be selective and make some judgment calls.</p>

<p><a name='acid stream'>Acid Stream</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level +1)<br>
<a name='toxic wave'>Toxic Wave</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level +2)<br>
These spells create a powerful corrosive that sprays the target, causing terrible burns and eating away organic and metallic material. Anyone in full-body armor treated to resist toxic materials (like a firefighter’s suit) takes no damage. The acid creates a cloud of thick, choking fumes: add +4 to all target numbers for those in the affected area for the rest of the Combat Turn. The affected area is also considered treacherous ground for the rest of the Combat Turn (p. 108). Anything hit by acid can be melted into sludge by the secondary effects, or at least badly pitted and burned. Vehicle tires may flatten. Armor can be reduced by –1 to both Ballistic and Impact ratings by being melted and burned. If the spellcaster chooses to cast the spell with a Damage Code of D, even firearms can be corroded into junk. The acid quickly evaporates in the turn following the spell’s casting, but the damage remains. Acid Stream is a single-target spell, while Toxic Wave is an area spell.</p>

<p><a name='flamethrower'>Flamethrower</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level +1)<br>
<a name='fireball'>Fireball</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level +2)<br>
These spells create flames the caster can direct. The flames flash into existence and burn out after striking the target, but can ignite flammable materials, which will continue to burn after the spell is exhausted. For highly flammable materials (gasoline, dry wood, paper, explosives and ammunition) subtract 1 from their Resistance to determine secondary effects. If clothing ignites, the wearer takes 6M damage at the end of every turn until the flames are extinguished. Treat exploding ammunition, grenades and such as a weapon hit, with armor doing nothing to reduce the damage. Combat Pool dice can help resist damage as the singed target tries to hurl the exploding material away. Vehicle fuel may explode, but a vehicle gets +2 to its Object Resistance, unless its fuel is exposed to the open air. Flamethrower is a single target spell, while Fireball is an area spell, creating an explosion of flames.</p>

<p><a name='lightning bolt'>Lightning Bolt</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level +1)<br>
<a name='ball lightning'>Ball Lightning</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: +1(Damage Level +2)<br>
These spells create and direct electricity. Lightning can short out or overload electronics (with –1 to the equipment’s Resistance) and may ignite flammable materials (like the fire spells above). Metallic armor provides no protection, but special insulation or lack of grounding (a flying or levitating target, for example) may reduce the Power of the attack at the gamemaster’s discretion. Lightning Bolt is a single target spell. Ball Lightning is an area spell.</p>

<hr>

<h5><a name='telekin'>TELEKINETIC MANIPULATIONS</a></h5>

<p>Telekinetic spells allow the caster to exert pure magical force against physical objects to move them.</p>

<p><a name='clout'>Clout</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: (Damage Level)<br>
Clout creates a bolt of invisible psychokinetic force that does stun damage. It is targeted as a normal Ranged Attack, using the Sorcery Test in place of the Combat Skill Test. Impact armor protects against the damage.</p>

<p><a name='fling'>Fling</a><br>
Type: P • Target: See text • Duration: I • Drain: +1(M)<br>
This spell psychokinetically hurls a single object of no more than (Magic Attribute) kilograms at a designated target with a Strength equal to the spell’s Force. The caster must touch the item to be thrown. Treat the Sorcery Test as a normal Ranged Combat Test for the purposes of the item hitting the target. Throwing weapons propelled by this spell use their normal range based on the spell’s effective Strength.</p>

<p><a name='levitate'>Levitate</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +2(M)<br>
Levitate allows the caster to telekinetically lift an object and move it around. The subject of the spell can be moved anywhere in the caster’s line of sight at a rate of speed equal to the caster’s Magic Attribute multiplied by the number of successes (up to a maximum equal to the spell’s Force) from the Sorcery Test in meters per turn. The target number of the Sorcery Test is increased by +1 for every full 100 kilograms of mass of the object. Objects flung into other things are considered to hit with a Damage Code of (Movement Rate ÷ 10)M Stun. Especially sharp or dangerous objects may do physical damage at the gamemaster’s discretion. If the caster is attempting to levitate an item held by a living being, the holder can make a Strength Test to resist the spell. The caster must have at least 1 net success to levitate the item away. If the caster is attempting to levitate a living being, the target may resist the spell using Strength or Willpower (whichever is higher). You can use this spell to levitate yourself, if desired.</p>

<p><a name='magic fingers'>Magic Fingers</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 6 • Duration: S • Drain: +2(M)<br>
Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect like “invisible hands” that can hold or manipulate items. The successes on the Sorcery Test become the spell’s effective Strength and Quickness, up to the Force of the spell. The caster can use skills remotely with Magic Fingers, but all target numbers receive a +2 modifier due to problems of fine control. Even simple actions like picking up a coin may require a Quickness Test, at the gamemaster’s discretion. The caster can fight, pick a lock, or take any other action he desires using the magic fingers as if they were real hands. The spell can reach any point the caster can see, and Clairvoyance or remote-viewing technology can be used to get a close-up of the scene as long as it is within the caster’s normal line of sight. This spell comes in very handy for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.</p>

<p><a name='poltergeist'>Poltergeist</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(M)<br>
Poltergeist picks up all small objects within the spell’s area, up to a kilogram in mass, and whirls them around in random patterns. This imposes a +2 Visibility Modifier on the area. The spell does a base Light Stun damage as well, whacking targets with flying debris. Targets within the area use their Quickness, not Body, for their Damage Resistance Test each turn, with a target number equal to the Force of the spell. Impact Armor protects against the damage. Poltergeist may do physical damage if the gamemaster feels the debris is sufficiently dangerous (broken glass and nails, for example).</p>

<hr>

<h5><a name='transform'>TRANSFORMATION MANIPULATIONS</a></h5>

<p>Transformation manipulation spells create, control or transform matter and energy.</p>

<p><a name='armor'>Armor</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 6 • Duration: S • Drain: +2(M)<br>
This spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the target that protects against impact and ballistic damage. One success is enough to create the magical field around the character of an Armor Rating equal to the Force of the spell. The Armor spell is compatible with all armor types and adds its rating to the rating of the physical armor being worn. This spell either works or it doesn’t; extra successes do not add additional points to the Armor Rating.</p>

<p><a name='physical barrier'>Physical Barrier</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 6 • Duration: S • Drain: +2(S)<br>
<a name='astral barrier'>Astral Barrier</a><br>
Type: M • Target: 6 • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
Barrier spells create glowing, translucent force fields. One success is sufficient to form a field with a Barrier Rating equal to the spell’s Force. Every two successes increase the Barrier Rating by 1. The caster can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the spell’s normal radius. The caster can also form a wall with a height equal to the spell’s Force in meters and a length equal to the caster’s Magic Attribute. The caster can adjust the size of the barrier the same as the radius of an area spell (p. 181). Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases. Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. Attacks directed through a barrier have a Visibility Modifier of +1. The barrier does not impede spells, except for elemental spells, just like translucent glass. The barrier can be brought down by physical attacks. Any reductions in Barrier Rating are restored at the beginning of the next Combat Turn. If the barrier is penetrated, it collapses and the spell ends. Physical Barrier cannot be used on the astral plane. Astral Barrier functions the same as Physical Barrier, except on the astral plane. Astral Barrier is not a dual barrier and does not work on the physical plane.</p>

<p><a name='ice sheet'>Ice Sheet</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: I • Drain: +1(S)<br>
This spell creates a flat sheet of ice covering a radius equal to the caster’s Magic Attribute in meters. Characters crossing the sheet must make a Quickness (Force) Test to avoid falling prone, adding +1 to the targer number for every 2 successes, up to a maximum bonus equal to the Force of the spell. Vehicles must make a Crash Test (p. 147). The sheet melts at a rate of 1 square meter per minute in normal temperatures.</p>

<p><a name='ignite'>Ignite</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: P • Drain: +1(D)<br>
The Ignite spell accelerates molecular motion in the target, causing it to catch fire. The spell’s Threshold is half the target’s Body or Barrier Rating. The base time for the target to ignite is 10 turns, divided by the number of successes over the Threshold, limited to a number of successes equal to the spell’s force. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it burns up or is extinguished by smothering or water. Ignite wraps a living target in flames, causing 6M damage on the first turn. The Power increases by 1 per Combat Turn. Resolve the damage at the end of each turn by making a Damage Resistance Test. Impact Armor protects against this damage. Ammo or explosives carried by a victim may explode (see Flamethrower, p. 197). If flames are not extinguished, they burn out in 1D6 Combat Turns.</p>

<p><a name='light'>Light</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +2(M)<br>
This spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around it equal to the caster’s Magic in meters. The spell cannot be used to blind, but does offset darkness visibility modifiers, each success on the Sorcery Test counters a +1 modifier, up to a maximum equal to the spell’s Force.</p>

<p><a name='petrify'>Petrify</a><br>
Type: P • Target: B • Duration: S • Drain: +1(S)<br>
Petrify transforms living tissue into stone-like calcium carbonate. The Threshold is half the target’s Body. Non-living material—including clothing, gear and cyberware—is not affected. The target is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage suffered by the stone-like form affects the target normally. While petrified, the target has a Barrier Rating equal to Body + the Force of the Petrify spell.</p>

<p><a name='shadow'>Shadow</a><br>
Type: P • Target: 4 • Duration: S • Drain: +2M<br>
Shadow creates a globe of darkness with a radius equal to the caster’s Magic Attribute in meters. Every success imposes a +1 Visibility Modifier against targets within the area, up to a maximum of +8 or the Force of the spell (whichever is less).</p>
